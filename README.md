# Image-To-Ascii-converter
A console application, that converts images in various formats to ascii char 'images'

## Dependencies
For image loading and saving (for debug purposes) it used the rust crate [image(https://github.com/image-rs/image)].

## Image manipulation
The functions for resizing, dithering and greyscale conversion made be myself. Especially for dithering I read the [excellent article(https://tannerhelland.com/2012/12/28/dithering-eleven-algorithms-source-code.html)] from Tanner Helland. Self teaching about the resizing algorisms starts in the WIkipedia and follows the links from there. All over the net are many useful explanaitions about scaling an image.
